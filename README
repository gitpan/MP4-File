MP4::File is a module that offers both read and write access to MP4
files, while most (all?) other MP4 modules only offer read access.

The module uses libmp4v2 for MP4 file manipulation, so make sure
this is installed before trying to build MP4::File.

The module is currently lacking more documentation and tests.

I hacked this module because I needed to tag AAC files, and that's
the only thing that can currently be done with MP4::File. However,
there's a lot more that can be done using the underlying libmp4v2.
So if anyone would like to take over and enhance this module, feel
free to contact me.
